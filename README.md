# 💧 Water Quality Prediction - RMS

AICTE Internship Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the AICTE Internship project on Water Quality Prediction using Regression Modeling System (RMS). The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the quality of water based on various physical and chemical parameters, supporting efforts in environmental monitoring and public health.

## Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

📌 Project Overview

Water quality is a critical indicator for health and environmental sustainability. Through this internship, we applied Regression Modeling System (RMS) techniques to evaluate and predict water quality parameters based on a real-world dataset. This tool can be useful for water management authorities, researchers, and environmentalists.

🧠 Methodology
- Data Collection
   -- Used publicly available water quality datasets (customized if required for the region).
- Data Preprocessing
   -- Handled missing values, normalized data, and selected relevant features.
- Feature Engineering
   -- Evaluated correlations between parameters.
- Modeling using RMS
   -- Applied regression techniques such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge/Lasso Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor (optional)
     - Evaluated models based on RMSE, R² Score, and MAE.
- Prediction and Analysis
   -- Predicted water quality indices such as pH, DO, conductivity, etc.
   -- Compared predicted results with actual values to determine model performance.
